In this small project I implemented d-ary heap functions,
then created 3 randomized integer arrays: A sized 50, B sized 100 and C sized 200.
I then heap-sorted each array four times - for d=2 to d=5,
analyzed the amount of comparisons and copies that heapsort does,
and checked for which d is the most effective heapsort in terms of comparisons
and for which d is the most effective heapsort in terms of copies.
